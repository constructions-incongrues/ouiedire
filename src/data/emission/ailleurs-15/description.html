This is a fresh set of enjoyable, cheerful songs coming from the hands of mr ubunoir, 
who compiled and mixed some of his recent top picks in the way that meets the ouiedire standards. 
It is both cheap and rich sounding electronics, it has some heavy-sampled parts and catchy synthlines as well ..plus a
lot of beautiful singing too! If you want to listen to more of similar stuff in the classic play &amp; tell 
manner (often with more chiptunes and psychodelic shit added), please check out the <a href="http://istotassaca.blogspot.com">ISTOTA SSACA</a> podcast , 
which is also broadcasted in the polish <a href="http://sitka.pl/radio">radio*sitka</a>.
