<p>After having been saved from Covid precarity with a composition grant, I
considered I owe my native country (too often mocked by the French and by
myself) something back.
So, let’s bring to the fore the greatest Belgian instrument of all : The
Saxophone.
Here it is, babies, just for you : a Dixieland arrangement of my club music’s
favorite in a rough & tumble 1-hour mixtape that swings a lot and hurts a bit,
like in all good blues.
That’s not all, on the way to reach the saxophone climax, we accidentally
found the perfect brother for the fake brass when direct from Valencia City
unexpectedly, Hector Arnau joined as the Karaoke Superstar of the party.</p>
